# Bikesharing in Des Moines, Iowa

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to perform analysis of New York’s bike sharing company, Citi Bike, to create a proposal for seed funding to develop a similar business venture in Des Moines, Iowa. 

The dataset used for this analysis was trip data from New York in August 2019. The intention of the analysis performed was to understand in depth how share business actually works in New York City. Using Tableau, the visualizations created in the analysis process were assembled to deliver the necessary information to potential investors. 

## Results

The following is a breakdown of the visualizations that were included in the presentation to investors. To view the dashboard for this project, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/holly.ouellette#!/vizhome/Citi_Bike_Des_Moines/NYCStory">CLICK HERE</a>.

The first page of this presentation contains a dashboard providing a high-level analysis of the customers who use Citi Bike in Des Moines. 
<br><br>
The intention of starting the analysis with this information is to capture the investor’s attention through knowing who is using the service, when they are using it, and the total number of trips that took place in the month of August.

<br><br>
The third page of the presentation contains a dashboard that contains three visualizations. 
<br><br>
The purpose of this dashboard is to, in one page, tell a deeper story into Citi Bike’s ridership in August 2019. This dashboard showcases the variations by gender in the service usage as well as how the variations differ when filtered by customer type.

**Page 4**
<br><br>
The fourth page is included in the presentation to provide a visualization to the investor of the number of bikes that were used in New York City in August 2019. 
<br><br>
In addition, with the exception of some outliers, this visualization let’s the investor know that with more bikes included in the fleet, each unique bike is used less. In addition to enhanced accessibility to users, a large bike fleet results in less ware and tare on the bikes, thereby requiring less of a maintenance cost.
