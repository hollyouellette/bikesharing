# Bikesharing in Des Moines, Iowa

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to perform analysis of New Yorkâ€™s bike sharing company, Citi Bike, to create a proposal for seed funding to develop a similar business venture in Des Moines, Iowa. 

The dataset used for this analysis was trip data from New York in August 2019. The intention of the analysis performed was to understand in depth how share business actually works in New York City. Using Tableau, the visualizations created in the analysis process were assembled to deliver the necessary information to potential investors.
