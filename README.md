# Bikesharing in Des Moines, Iowa

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to perform analysis of New York’s bike sharing company, Citi Bike, to create a proposal for seed funding to develop a similar business venture in Des Moines, Iowa. 

The dataset used for this analysis was trip data from New York in August 2019. The intention of the analysis performed was to understand in depth how share business actually works in New York City. Using Tableau, the visualizations created in the analysis process were assembled to deliver the necessary information to potential investors.

The intention of starting the analysis with this information is to capture the investor’s attention through knowing who is using the service, when they are using it, and the total number of trips that took place in the month of August.
