# Bikesharing in Des Moines, Iowa

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to perform analysis of New York’s bike sharing company, Citi Bike, to create a proposal for seed funding to develop a similar business venture in Des Moines, Iowa. 

The dataset used for this analysis was trip data from New York in August 2019. The intention of the analysis performed was to understand in depth how share business actually works in New York City. Using Tableau, the visualizations created in the analysis process were assembled to deliver the necessary information to potential investors. 

## Results

The following is a breakdown of the visualizations that were included in the presentation to investors. To view the dashboard for this project, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/holly.ouellette#!/vizhome/Citi_Bike_Des_Moines/NYCStory">CLICK HERE</a>.

**Page 1**
<br><br>
The first page of this presentation contains a dashboard providing a high-level analysis of the customers who use Citi Bike in Des Moines. 
<br><br>
The intention of starting the analysis with this information is to capture the investor’s attention through knowing who is using the service, when they are using it, and the total number of trips that took place in the month of August.

<br><br>
The second page of this presentation is a single visualization to showcase the trip duration against the number of bikes in the Citi Bike fleet.
<br><br>
This visualisation is intended to show the investors that this service is generally used for short-duration trips. Additionally, this graph is an prelude to dig in deeper to this visualization and better understand who exactly is using the service to make these trips.

<br><br>
The third page of the presentation contains a dashboard that contains three visualizations. 
<br><br>
The purpose of this dashboard is to, in one page, tell a deeper story into Citi Bike’s ridership in August 2019. This dashboard showcases the variations by gender in the service usage as well as how the variations differ when filtered by customer type.

<br><br>
The fourth page is included in the presentation to provide a visualization to the investor of the number of bikes that were used in New York City in August 2019. 
<br><br>
In addition, with the exception of some outliers, this visualization let’s the investor know that with more bikes included in the fleet, each unique bike is used less. In addition to enhanced accessibility to users, a large bike fleet results in less ware and tare on the bikes, thereby requiring less of a maintenance cost.

**Page 5**
<br><br>
The final page of this presentation is a deep-dive into the trip duration for each bike in the fleet. 
<br><br>
The purpose of this visualization is to showcase that while there are many bikes in circulation, there is only a small portion that would soon require maintenance due to the total about of time each bike has been used. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Summary

In summary, this investigation yielded the following results:
<br><br>
1.	An understanding of the clientele of Citi Bike based on the following:

      **Customer Type**

      Approximately 80% of the Citi Bike clientele are subscribers who use the service on an ongoing basis.

      **Customer Age**

      A significant portion of Citi Bike’s ridership were born between the years 1968-1997 (24 to 53 years in age).

     **Customer Gender**

      Based on this analysis, we see that men tend to use the Citi Bike service more than women and also use the bikes for longer trip durations. 
<br><br>
2.	An understanding of the fleet size and the impact this has on ongoing bike maintenance. Based on this analysis, we learned that an upfront investment in having a high number of bikes in rotation will result in fewer bikes requiring services due to high usage.
<br><br>
3.	A knowledge of the peak times that the Citi Bike service is used:

      **Weekdays**: 6:00am-9:00am & 5:00pm-7:00pm
      **Weekends**: 10:00am – 7:00pm
<br><br>

After completing this analysis, I would recommend the following two visualizations for further investigation:

<br><br>
   1. *Trips by Weekday Hour filtered by Customer Type*. This visualization will enable use to better understand which peak trip hours can be attributed to Customers vs. Subscribers and if there is a relationship between the customer type and when the bikes are being used. 

   2. *Customers by Age and Type*. This visualization will help us better understand if there are differences in how particular age demographics engage with this service.
